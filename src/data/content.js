    body1: 'Typography is more than choosing a font — it\'s about shaping experience. Every letterform carries weight, mood, and history that speaks before the reader consciously registers it. When a reader encounters a block of text, the typeface forms a silent handshake, establishing trust and intent before a single word is processed.',

    body2: 'The best type pairs feel inevitable, as if they were always meant to coexist. They balance contrast with harmony: a serif that anchors and a sans-serif that breathes. Finding this balance requires an understanding of proportion, x-height, and the underlying geometry of the letters.',
    body3: 'When we read, our eyes do not glide smoothly across the text. Instead, they dart from point to point in microscopic jumps called saccades, briefly pausing to process chunks of letterforms. Good typography facilitates this silent rhythm. It creates a seamless path for the eye, ensuring that meaning is absorbed effortlessly.',
    body4: 'Ultimately, choosing the right typographic voice means understanding your message. A geometric sans-serif might convey modern efficiency, while a classic serif speaks of heritage and trust. As designers, our job is not just to make words legible, but to make them felt.',
